During the last years of her reign, **[Gormflaith nic Caindelban](../p/gormflaith_nic_caindelban_1171.md)** tried to find a way to avoid splitting the realm on her death. As things were standing, with maxim crown authority, she could pick an heir, but she could not avoid a split. [Abel mac Gormflaith](../p/abel_mac_gormflaith_1190.md) would get Ireland, Munster and the Counties in Wales, but his brother **[Labraid mac Gormflaith](../p/labraid_mac_gormflaith_1188.md)** would still get Leinster

After much swaying, Gormflaith got "High Partition" approved, but this did not solve any problem - the partition would happen in the same way. As she did not like her son Labraid, she disinherited him, but this did not solve the issue, as her grandson [Duke Flaithgus mac Cuan of Deheubarth](../p/flaithgus_mac_cuan_1236.md) took his place as a second heir. Gormflaith gave Labraid the **Earldom of Ferlix** as a consolation.

She gave then her grandson Flaithgus independence - he turned into a **Petty King of Deheubarth**. But still, he would inherit Leinster. In hindsight, she might have changed the succession law of the **Duchy of Leinster** into feudal succession, and that should have achieved the result she was hoping for. Regrettably, she wasn't aware or did not understand such an option. 

Anyway, her grandson could not veto reforms any longer, and  In her desperation she passed the house seniority succession law, and by sheer luck her son Abel was first in the line of succession. That happened in the nick of time, as Gormflaith passed away in 1253, at the age of 81. Her son Abel succeeded her, already being 62 years old. However, he had already completed the tratis "Whole of Body" and "Thelogian".



During the first months Abel had to deal with internal issues, such as unhappy vassals. He helped his ally [Petty King Flaithgus mac Cuan of Dehuerbarth](../p/flaithgus_mac_cuan_1236.md)  defend against an attack from Gloucestershire for the **Lordship of Morgannwg**.

He had also to monitor who would succed him, as the  house seniority succession law was showing its flaws. The first heir in line, Saebert  Haroldson Braiain, was infirm and had horrible skills, so Abel choose to disinherit him. The second in line, Lorcan mac Morien Briain, was unimpressive but still somewhat reasonable. Restoring the inheritance of [Labraid mac Gormflaith](../p/labraid_mac_gormflaith_1188.md) set him up as the new player heir.
