### King Caindelban mac Faelban of Ireland, 1167

In 1155 High King  [**Caindelban mac Faelan**](../p/caindelban_i_mac_faelan_1114.md) of Ireland decided to move on and unify Ireland at last. He declared war on his brother [**Conmal mac Faelan**](../p/conmal_mac_faelan_1122.md), **Petty King of Ulster**, and in a quick campaign conquered the kingdom. He then granted his brother the title of **Duke of Ulster,** without revoking any other title.

He then completed the reunification of Ireland, pressing his brother **Conmal**'s claim over de jure territories in the Duchy of Ulster, specifically the Earldom of **Ailech**, still occupied by Caindelban's cousin **[King Haraldr II Haraldrsson of the Sudreyjar](../p/haraldr_ii_1125.md).** After a costly campaign, in 1158, this Earldom too was brought under Conmal mac Faelan's sovereignty.

Then, still in 1158, Caindelban used a claim from his vassal **[Lord Riaged ap Cynddylan of Merionnydd](../p/riaged_ap_cynddylan_1169.md)** of the house **Caerloyw-Penfro,** his second cousin [**Lord Cynddylan ap Gruffydd**](../p/cynddylan_ap_gruffydd_1099.md)'s son, to put him in on the throne of **Deheubarth** in 1160**.** Lord Riaged himself was overthrown in 1162 by his uncle and Caindelban's second cousin **[Duke Rhufon ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth](../p/rhufon_ap_gruffydd_1140.md)**.

Between 1160 and 1167 the Kingdom of Ireland had reached its maximum extension in his history so far and with it the indissolubly related diffusion of the Paulician religion.

The **Duchy of Mercia** had been created, too, and assigned to Caindelban's nephew [**Duke Gilla-Ruad mac Fiachne of Mercia**,](../p/gilla-ruad_mac_fiachnae_1142.md) from the house **gCais-Cruachu,** who also controlled the **Earldom of Nottinghamshire.** Gilla-Ruad had been assigned the two vassals, and Candailban's chilren, Prince  **[Caindelban mac Caindelban](../p/caindelban_ii_mac_caindelban_1147.md),** still **Earl of Huntingdonshire** and **Northamptonshire,** and **[Prince Dinertach mac Caindelban](../p/dinertach_mac_caindelban_1141.md),** still **Earl of Worcestershire** and **Warwickshire.**

However, in 1163 there was a devastating setback - the Pope declared a **Crusade** against the Paulician faith over the **Kingdom of England**. Crusader forces outnumbered Paulicians 3 to 1, and on top of that, Irish leaders had no experience fighting crusades. After four years of war, Ireland conceded defeat and gave up on all territories in England. **Mercia** was restored to **King Duff** of England. However, [High King Caindelban mac Faelan](../p/caindelban_i_mac_faelan_1114.md) stayed in full control of Ireland and Wales.

In 1167, Caindelban owned the titles of **King of Ireland** and **Wales, Petty King of Munster** and **Leinster, Earl of Thomond, Ossory, Leinster** and **Ormond.** His vassals were:

- His brother **[Duke Conmal mac Faelan](../p/conmal_mac_faelan_1122.md)** of **Ulster**
- His nephew [**Duke Aengus mac Cobflaith**](../p/aengus_i_mac_cobflaith_1123.md) of **Meath**
- His second cousin [**Duchess Nest ferch Morien of Gwynedd**]((../p/nest_ferch_morien_1104.md)) from the house **Caerloyw-Tyddewi**

- **[Duke Cynwrig ab Rhufon of Deheubarth](../p/cynwrig_ap_rhufon_1157.md)** , whose father **[Duke Rhufon ap Gruffydd](../p/rhufon_ap_gruffydd_1140.md)**, Caindalban's second cousin**,** had also died during the crusade
