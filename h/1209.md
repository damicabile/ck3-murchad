### High King Caindelban II of Ireland, 1209

[**Caindelban II**](../p/caindelban_ii_mac_caindelban_1147.md) concentrated on learning and building up his realm - he wasn't set on expansion and conquest. However, that didn't mean he would be left alone. In 1195, **King Evander** of England took **Deheubarth** from Caindelban II's vassal King  **[Congalach ab Caindelban](../p/congalach_ab_caindelban_1148.md)' of Wales**' vassal **[Lord Cynwrig ap Rhufon of Ynys Mon](../p/cynwrig_ap_rhufon_1157.md)** in a holy war, which meant that all other vassals were also deposed.

In 1200, King Caindelban II helped **King Conall II of Scotland**, whom he was allied with through marriage between his son **[Flaitheman](../p/flaitheman_nic_caindelban_1175.md)** with **Princess Marthoc of Scotland**, win the **Earldom of Inverness** from **Petty King Haraldr II Haraldrsson of MÃ¶n**.

However, the priority was to recover the lost territories in Wales, and for that he declared war over the title of Wales to his brother **[King Congalach ab Caindelban](../p/congalach_ab_caindelban_1148.md) of Wales**. He called his ally **[Captain Fiachnae mac Gilla-Ruad of Band of Kerns](../p/fiachnae_mac_gilla-ruad_1167.md),** his cousin **[Gilla-Ruad mac Fiachnae gCais-Cruachu](../p/gilla-ruad_mac_fiachnae_1142.md)**'s son, to arms. In December 1201, King caindelban II recovered the title of King of Wales, and took his brother Congalach as vassal.

That was not the end of it, as Congalach was at the same time defending against two holy wars for the **Lordship of Ferlix** and **Duchy of Powys,** respectively against **Lord Matad of Brycheniog** and **Countess Sig Wulfdohtor of Herefordshire**. Right after conquering Wales, caindelban II dealt with these two enemies swiftly, at the same time also helping **King Conall II** defend against the rebel vassal **Banmormaer Anlaith MacFaeldobur of Caithness**. After that, the realm of Ireland was unified, but **Deheubarth** was still in the hands of **King Evander of England**.

In 1204, Caindelban II had to face a revolt for higher autonomy from his vassals, led by his cousin **[Duke Briccene mac Conmal ](../p/briccene_mac_conmal_1158.md)of Ulster and Gwynedd,** founder and head of the house **gCais-Padraig**, and his brother **[Prince Finnacan mac Caindelban of Ireland](../p/finnacan_mac_caindelban_1161.md), Duke of Leinster,** founder and head of the house **gCais-Gabhran.** Both had a respectable army, so help from the allies Captain Fiachnae and King Conall II was more than welcome. Only in June 1207 did King Caindelban II manage to crush the revolt, the leaders were imprisoned and had to give up their titles. King Caidelban moved on to reassign them.

So in 1209, High King Caindelban II mac Caindelban was holding the titles of **King and Ireland and Wales, Petty King of Munster and Leinster, Earl of Thomond, Ormond, Desmond, Leinster and Ossory.** His vassals were:

- caindelban II's cousin late **[Aengus mac Cobflaith](../p/aengus_i_mac_cobflaith_1123.md)**'s son **[Lord Rian ab Aengus of Meath](../p/rian_i_ab_aengus_1144.md)**

Caindelban II had three sons (**Caindelban**, **[Flaitheman](../p/flaitheman_nic_caindelban_1175.md)** and **[Loeguire](../p/loeguire_mac_caindelban_1182.md)**) and one daughter (**[Gormflaith](../p/gormflaith_nic_caindelban_1171.md)**) None of these had good skills, but anyway Caindelban had picked Flaitheman as a main heir.
