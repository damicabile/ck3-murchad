### Petty King Faelan mac Brian of Munster, 1133

During the last years of his reign the **Petty King [Faelan mac Brian](../p/faelan_mac_brian_1084.md)** ensured a total control of Ireland by the house Briain, by means of a couple of holy wars. 

In 1129 he conquered **Mayo** from the house **Cetchathach-Gaillimhe,** a house without any recognizable relation with the **Dal-Gcais** dinasty.

In 1131 he conquered the **Earldoms of Athlone** and **Dubhlinn**, along with the **Petty Kingdom of Meath**, from his distant relative **[Murchad mac Domnall](../p/murchad_mac_domnall_1118.md) ua Cheinnselaig**. During this war, regrettably, **[Brian mac Faelan](../p/brian_mac_faelan_1112.md)**, [King Faelan](../p/faelan_mac_brian_1084.md)'s oldest son and first heir, found his death. 

King Faelan therefore was holding the titles of **King of Munster, Gwynedd, Powys** and **Leinster,** along with the titles of **Earl of Thomond, Ossory, Leinster** and **Dubhlinn.** He had 9 vassals

- **Lord [Rhiwallon](../p/rhiwallon_1087.md) the Foolish of Ferlix**, now also **Lord of Penllyn** (distant relative)
- His cousin **Lord [Elidyr ab Iorwerth](../p/elidyr_ab_iorwerth_1085.md) of Merionnydd** (now also **Lord of Dyfed** and **Ynis Mon**)
- **Countess [Flann nig Olav](../p/flann_nig_olav_1097.md) of Ormond,** also **Earl of Ui Mhaine** daughter of **Earl [Olav mac Ragnvald](../p/olav_mac_ragnvald_1066.md)**
- **Lord [Naufedd ap Gruffydd](../p/naufedd_ap_gruffydd_1121.md) ab Perfeddwlad**, from the house of **Seisyll**, son of **Lord [Gruffydd ab Idwal](../p/gruffydd_ab_idwal_1072.md)**, also **Lord of Ceredigion**
- His uncle **Lord [Cynfyn ap Morien](../p/cynfyn_ap_morien_1077.md) of Eryri** ( His mother Hunydd's brother) 
- **Earl [Udalschalk mag Eilika](../p/udalschalk_mag_eilika_1096.md) of Mayo**, from the obscure **Cilli** dynasty, also **Earl of Athlone,** who had married matrilineally Faelan's daughter **[Cobflaith nic Faelan](../p/cobflaith_nic_faelan_1101.md)**
- **Countess [Affraic nig Olav](../p/affraic_nig_olav_1112.md) of Desmond** - daughter of **Earl [Olav mac Ragnvald](../p/olav_mac_ragnvald_1066.md)**

Meanwhile, Faelan's uncle **[Enguerrand mac Murchad](../p/enguerrand_mac_murchad_1081.md)** had conquered the titles of **King of Ulster,** which now held together with the **Earldoms of Ennis, Ulster** and **Briefne.** His vassals were Faelan's younger brother **[Sean mac Brian](../p/sean_mac_brian_1101.md)**, from which he had usurped the title of **King of Ulster**, but who in turn had managed to hold on to the title of **Earl of Oriel,** and Faelan's cousin **Earl [Ailpin mac Donnchad](../p/ailpin_mac_donnchad_1101.md) of Ailech.**

Faelan's sister **[Cathan nic Brian](../p/cathan_nic_brian_1078.md)**, who had a claim to all titles in the family, was languishing with her husband **[Aed mac Domnall](../p/aed_mac_domnall_1078.md)** at her daughter **Mayor [Ellbrig nic Cathan](../p/ellbrig_nic_cathan_1109.md) of Sligo**'s court, who herself was a vassal of **Earl [Udalschalk mag Eilika](../p/udalschalk_mag_eilika_1096.md) of Mayo**.

There had been a few more childbirths in Briain's family, but also two deaths. Apart from the death of [Faelan mac Brian](../p/faelan_mac_brian_1084.md)'s first heir, Brian, also his sister, **Countess [Lasairfiona nic Brian](../p/lasairfiona_nic_brian_1100.md) of Cleves**, had died to the bubonic plague.

In the succession (still Confederate partition) **[Caindelban I mac Faelan](../p/caindelban_i_mac_faelan_1114.md)** would have inherited the **Kingdoms of Munster** and **Leinster,** along with the **Earldoms of Thomond, Ossory** and **Leinster**. **[Conmal mac Faelan](../p/conmal_mac_faelan_1122.md)** would inherit the **Kingdoms of Gwynedd** and **Meath** and the **Earldom of Dubhlinn**, and **[Fiachnae mac Faelan](../p/fiachnae_mac_faelan_1125.md)** would receive **the Kingdoms of Powys and Connacht**.

**[Caindelban I mac Faelan](../p/caindelban_i_mac_faelan_1114.md)** was now married with **[Flann nic Rois](../p/flann_nic_rois_1117.md) ua Neill Noigiallach**. Flann's mother **[Rois nic Domnall](../p/rois_nic_domnall_1071.md) Neill** had married Faelan's uncle **Earl [Donnchad mac Murchad](../p/donnchad_mac_murchad_1068.md)** and born Faelan's cousin Earl [Ailpin mac Donnchad](../p/ailpin_mac_donnchad_1101.md) of Ailech. Flann's father **[Domnall mac Flaithbertach](../p/domnall_mac_flaithbertach_1069.md) ua Neill Noigiallach** had his title of Earl of Oriel revoked from Faelan's half brother [Sean mac Brian](../p/sean_mac_brian_1101.md).

For a change, it seemed that the Faelan's first heir had good skills. Unlike his predecessors, this one would be a good steward.
