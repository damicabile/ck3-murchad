### High King Caindelban mac Faelan of Ireland in 1186

By the year 1186 the borders of Ireland had not changed, as [**Caindelban**](../p/caindelban_i_mac_faelan_1114.md) was still licking his wounds after the shock of the defeat against the crusaders. He had turned out to be a good steward and developed the traits **Architect** and Avaricious, along with **Thrifty Clerk,** which gave him a total stewardship of 18 and some building bonuses. Rather than start other wars, he concentrated on reorganizing his realm and make it more economically viable. He was in fact making 37.1 gold a month, so that he could finance a fairly big army easily.

Caindelban's nephew [**Duke Aengus mac Cobflaith of Meath**](../p/aengus_i_mac_cobflaith_1123.md) owned the titles of **Duke of Meath and Earl** of **Dubhlinn**, and as vassal Caindelban's nephew [**Earl Abban mac Cobflaith of Athlone**](../p/abban_mac_cobflaith_1132.md), like 20 years before.

As for family, Caindelban's first wife **Flann nic Rois** had died in 1172. after giving him sevenchildren: **Aibilin (f),** late **Faelan (m)**, late **Sithmaith (f)**, [**Dinertach (m)**](../p/dinertach_mac_caindelban_1141.md), [**Caindelban (m)**](../p/caindelban_ii_mac_caindelban_1147.md), [**Congalach (m)**](../p/congalach_ab_caindelban_1148.md), **Finnalach (m).** He had remarried, with queen **Sofia Styrbjornsdatter** from the house **Orkneyjar**, but she had not given him any children.

Faelan had only daughters and the underwhelming Dinertach had been disinherited, which made Caindelban II the next heir in line, who was bound to inherit the whole of Munster and associated titles. Congalach would get Wales, Finnacan Leinster and Connacht. The brothers were all about equally skilled.
