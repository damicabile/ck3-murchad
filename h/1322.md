In 1322, **Queen Slaine** was called to war by her independent ally **Duke Udo of Friuli** over the **Grand City of Veneto**. It was't a war that required much support from France, therefore in 1323 she declared a holy war to **Queen Glouimed verch Treveur of Brittany** over her **Petty Kingdom of Brittany**. By 1324, France had won the war and acquired those territories as well.
