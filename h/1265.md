During the last years of her reign, **[Gormflaith nic Caindelban](../p/gormflaith_nic_caindelban_1171.md)** tried to find a way to avoid splitting the realm on her death. As things were standing, with maxim crown authority, she could pick an heir, but she could not avoid a split. [Abel mac Gormflaith](../p/abel_mac_gormflaith_1190.md) would get Ireland, Munster and the Counties in Wales, but his brother **[Labraid mac Gormflaith](../p/labraid_mac_gormflaith_1188.md)** would still get Leinster

Gormflaith ended up disinheriting Labraid, and giving him as consolation the **Earldom of Ferlix**. He granted her grandson [Duke Flaithgus mac Cuan of Deheubarth](../p/flaithgus_mac_cuan_1236.md) independence, but this wasn't enough to remove him from the inheritance line. In hindsight, she might have changed the succession law of the **Duchy of Leinster** into feudal succession, and that would have achieved the result she was hoping for. 

Gormflaith ended up passing the house seniority succession law, and by sheer luck her son Abel was first in the line of succession. That happened in the nick of time, as Gormflaith passed away in 1253, at the age of 81. Her son Abel succeeded her, already being 62 years old.

During the first months [Abel](..p/abel_mac_gormflaith_1190.md) had to deal with internal issues, such as unhappy vassals. He helped his ally [Petty King Flaithgus mac Cuan of Dehuerbarth](../p/flaithgus_mac_cuan_1236.md)  defend against an attack from Gloucestershire for the **Lordship of Morgannwg**.

Abel is considered one of our greatest kings and mainly for two reasons. First, because of his war against England. The Kingdom of England had been severely weakened by continuous internal infighting, so that by 1258 they could field just 5000 men. Abel seized the opportunity and declared an holy war for the Kingdom. This was the war of his life and he called all possible house and dynasty members to war.

With such a formidable coalition, the war was over by 1260 - England was conquered and became part of Ireland. The next issue would be to assign the newly conquered territories to loyal and solid vassals - which was easier said than done. Moreover, an outrageous peasant revolt broke in England - King Abel, however, managed to put it down by 1261
