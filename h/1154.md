### King Caindelban mac Faelban of Ireland, 1154



Before 1141 was over, **King Caindelban mac Faelan** had managed to reclaim the **Duchy of Gwynedd**, turning **Lord Cynddylan ab Gruffyyd** into his vassal. In 1145, he had moved on to reclaim the title of **Duchy of Powys.**

In 1148, he helped his vassal **Lord Elidyr ab Iorwerth of Dyfed,** and nephew of his great-mother **Hunydd ferch Bleddyn Mathrafal**, claim the title of **King of Dehuerbarth** from **Prince Gruffydd IV ab Maredudd**. That meant, regrettably, that King Elidyr declared independence. In 1849, he abdicated in favour of his son **Prince Iorwerth ap Gwenllian ob Deheubarth,** who had partly taken his name from his mother **Prince Gwenllian ferch Meilys.**

In 1148, great-uncle **Enguerrand mac Murchad of Ulster** died, leaving the **Kingdom and Earldom of Ulster** to his first son **Petty King Murchad II mag Enguerrand of Ulster** and the Earldom of Breifne to his grand son **Earl Cormac mac Bruatur of Breifne**, second heir in line, whose father had died in battle in 1135. Enguerrand's oldest daughter **Deirdre nig Enguerrand** and the youngest son **Constantin mac Mael-Muire** stayed on the sidelines as claimants.

Meanwhile, several wars had weakened Britain. The last development had seen the king of Scotland, **King Duff II,** claim huge chunks of England and declare himself King of England in 1145, but he was now overextended, King Caindelban of Irlande declared an holy war on him 1149, which lead to Ireland's conquest of Mercia in 1152. 

 In a curious turn of event, the scot King Duff lost the title of King of Scotland in 1151 to **King Andrew**, who was installed by faction demand.

After that, there war a couple of minor setbacks for Ireland. In 1153, Caindelban's cousin **Halardr II Haraldrsson of the Sudreyjar**, from the house Crovan, a son of Caindelban's mother's brother **late Petty King Haraldr I**, took Ailech from Murchad II mag Enguerrand in a holy war, leaving **Domnall mag** **Ailpin gCais-Fathain** unlanded, and Caindelban's cousin **Earl Cuanu mac Sean of Oriel** dead in the battlefield. Caidelban's brother and vassal **Conmal mac Faelan**, who was **Earl of Dubhlinn,** used the opportunity and to attack his relative Murchad II and take from him the title of **King of Ulster**, but not the **Earldom of Ulster**, and declare himself independent in the process. 

Also in 1154, King Caindelban mac Faealan created the title of **High King of Ireland**, which would possibly lead to a consolidation of Ireland. The Duchy of Mercia had not been created yet, but care was given to distribute the Earldoms there located inside of the **gCais-Dal** dinasty.
