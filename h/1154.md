### King Caindelban mac Faelban of Ireland, 1154



Before 1141 was over, **King [Caindelban I mac Faelan](../p/caindelban_i_mac_faelan_1114.md)** had managed to reclaim the **Duchy of Gwynedd**, turning **Lord [Cynddylan ap Gruffydd](../p/cynddylan_ap_gruffydd_1099.md)** into his vassal. In 1145, he had moved on to reclaim the title of **Duchy of Powys.**

In 1148, he helped his vassal **Lord [Elidyr ab Iorwerth](../p/elidyr_ab_iorwerth_1085.md)  of Dyfed,** and nephew of his great-mother **[Hunydd ferch Bleddyn](../p/hunydd_ferch_bleddyn_1042.md) Mathrafal**, claim the title of **King of Dehuerbarth** from **Prince Gruffydd IV ab Maredudd**. That meant, regrettably, that King [Elidyr](../p/elidyr_ab_iorwerth_1085.md) declared independence. In 1849, he abdicated in favour of his son **Prince Iorwerth ap Gwenllian ob Deheubarth,** who had partly taken his name from his mother **Prince Gwenllian ferch Meilys.**

In 1148, great-uncle **[Enguerrand mac Murchad](../p/enguerrand_mac_murchad_1081.md)** died, leaving the **Kingdom and Earldom of Ulster** to his first son **Petty King [Murchad mag Enguerrand](../p/murchad_mag_enguerrand_1102.md)  of Ulster** and the Earldom of Breifne to his grand son **Earl [Cormac mac Bruatur](../p/cormac_mac_bruatur_1133.md) of Breifne**, second heir in line, whose father had died in battle in 1135.

Meanwhile, several wars had weakened Britain. The last development had seen the king of Scotland, **King Duff II,** claim huge chunks of England and declare himself King of England in 1145, but he was now overextended, King Caindelban of Irland declared an holy war on him 1149, which lead to Ireland's conquest of Mercia in 1152. 

 In a curious turn of event, the scot King Duff lost the title of King of Scotland in 1151 to **King Andrew**, who was installed by faction demand.

After that, there war a couple of minor setbacks for Ireland. In 1153, Caindelban's cousin **[Haraldr II](../p/haraldr_ii_1125.md)Haraldrsson of the Sudreyjar**, from the house Crovan, a son of Caindelban's mother's brother late **Petty King Haraldr I**, took Ailech from **[Murchad mag Enguerrand](../p/murchad_mag_enguerrand_1102.md)** in a holy war, leaving **Domnall mag Ailpin gCais-Fathain** unlanded, and Caindelban's cousin **Earl [Cuanu mac Sean](../p/cuanu_mac_sean_1121.md) of Oriel** dead in the battlefield. Caidelban's brother and vassal **[Conmal mac Faelan](../p/conmal_mac_faelan_1122.md)**, who was **Earl of Dubhlinn,** used the opportunity and to attack his relative Murchad II and take from him the title of **King of Ulster**, but not the **Earldom of Ulster**, and declare himself independent in the process. 

Also in 1154, **King [Caindelban I mac Faelan](../p/caindelban_i_mac_faelan_1114.md)** created the title of **High King of Ireland**, which would possibly lead to a consolidation of Ireland. The Duchy of Mercia had not been created yet, but care was given to distribute the Earldoms there located inside of the **gCais-Dal** dinasty.
